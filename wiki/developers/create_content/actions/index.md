# Actions

The application interpreter supports a set of actions that should be enough for most cases.

Below are some of them. You can find a complete list of actions and their descriptions in the specified source code file.

If none of the listed below actions fits your intention, you can [create your own action](create-action.md).

## Common action properties
### Interceptors
In some cases we need to add to action some information from environment of current scene. In that case we have interceptors

 - :from-params - this interceptors allow to copy data from params to action before execution.
   `:from-params [{:param-property 'scene-id', :action-property 'var-value'}]`
    - :param-property - params property name which will be used as source
    - :action-property - object property name to save value 
    - :template - if template is set value will be constructed by replacing every "%" sign with value, if not value will be set as is.

 - :from-var - this interceptors allow to copy data from variables to action before execution.
   `:from-var [{:var-name "item-1" :action-property "image" :var-property "image-src"}]`
    - :var-name - name of variable which will be used as source
    - :var-property - property of variable if only one property is needed
    - :var-key - if this property exist data will be converted to hash-map with var-key as key and value, as property value
    - :template - if template is set value will be constructed by replacing every "%" sign with value, if not value will be set as is.
    - :to-vector - boolean property, if true value will be added to vector
    - :action-property - property which will be used to place value to action, if it is not set data will be merged to action on root level.

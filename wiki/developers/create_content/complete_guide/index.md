# Complete Guide

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating an activity from start to finish.

We will create our own [component](component.md). Also we'll write a custom [action](action.md) to change the state of a component.

Then we will create a [template](template.md). And based on this template, we will create an [activity](activity.md) and add [dialogs](dialogs.md) to it.

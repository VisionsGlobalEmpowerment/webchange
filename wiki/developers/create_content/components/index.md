# Components

All objects that will be rendered on the screen (and sometimes not rendered, but presents invisibly) are called **components**.

The source code of all components is located in the folder `src/cljs/webchange/interpreter/renderer/scene/components/`.

There is a set of ready components that you can use in your activities. The list of [ready-to-use components can be found here](existing-components.md).

Also, you can create your own component and use it. Here is [how to create a new component](create-component.md).
